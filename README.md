In this project, we will analyze the personality of a person using his/her resume and the score of OCEAN parameters
OCEAN stands for openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism
Openness: Individuals high in openness are curious and eager to explore new ideas and experiences. They tend to be imaginative, insightful and have diverse interests.
Conscientiousness: Those with high conscientiousness are dependable and organized, valuing thoroughness and efficiency in their actions. They are known for their reliability, punctuality, and methodical approach to tasks.
Extraversion: Extraverts are characterized by their outgoing nature, drawing energy from social interactions and being lively and expressive. They are typically talkative, and assertive, and enjoy being in the company of others.
Agreeableness: People high in agreeableness are warm, compassionate, and cooperative. They prioritize kindness, empathy, and maintaining harmonious relationships with others.
Neuroticism: Neuroticism, or emotional instability, reflects a tendency towards experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and moodiness. Individuals high in neuroticism may often feel tense or exhibit mood swings.
code.ipnyb is the main code of the project 
There are 5 more ipnyb file of different Machine Learning algorithms. In those code we have analysed the accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score of each algorithms.
